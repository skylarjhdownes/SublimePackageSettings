These are my Sublime Text 3 settings.

To use them on a fresh install of Sublime, first install Package Control:
https://packagecontrol.io/installation

Next remove Sublime's User folder, usually located under `C:\Users\downes\AppData\Roaming\Sublime Text 3\Packages\User` on Windows
then `git clone ThisRepo.git User` to replace it.  (If you have a portable copy of Sublime, this folder is instead under `Sublime Text 3/Data/Packages/User`)

Sublime Package Control will automatically grab packages for you, but some dependencies, like CoffeeScript, may need to be installed manually.
